  - Familiarity with DICOM Image Format
  - Affine transformation
  - Math operations on images
    
- HW3(Spatial operations)
    - Spatial filtering
    - Linear and Nonlinear spatial Filtering
    - correlation and convolution in images
    - Smoothing and sharpening filters
    
- HW5(Restoration and morphological operations)
    - Types of noise distribution and Restoration filters
    - Adaptive Local noise reduction filter
    - Erosion and dilation, opening and closing
